//In useState if we give initial value as a string , instead of an empty array then we will get an error as data.map is not a function.

/*In lineNo:16 when we are iterating the data with li, if we give {item} we will get Objects are not valid as a
 React child (found: object with keys {userId, id, title, completed}). If you meant to render a collection of children,

 map function will loop through the array of objects , so in that particular object we need to choose what exactly we need to show in UI
 If we nned to show id then {item.id}
 If we need to show title then {item.title}
